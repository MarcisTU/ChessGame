<h1>ChessGame</h1>

Personal portfolio project that is developed parallel to learning C++ at university.
Goal is to create fully functional chess game using SDL2 library and C++/OOP.
Cool features like (captured peace visualization for each player, minimal sound effects for moving pieces, reset game etc) 
will be added after main logic is implemented.

<h3>Some cool features I personaly want to add in future</h3>
- Ability to play vs player using web server.<br/>
- Choice to rewind the game, meaning that player can go trough game history to see every move taken in that game. (Probably can use stack to save every move from the game.)<br/>  
- More to come :}<br/>
